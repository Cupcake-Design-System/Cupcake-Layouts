    <h2>Below this is dummy text.</h2>
    <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Rorschach would say you have
      a hard time relating to others. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Pretend. You pretend the feelings are
      there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my
        own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</li>
      <li>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</li>
      <li>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>This man is a knight in shining armor.</h3>
    <p>You look…perfect. I like seafood. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I am not a killer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're a killer. I catch killers.</li>
      <li>I'm really more an apartment person.</li>
      <li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to
      discuss. After all, you are a client. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.</p>
    <p>Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Finding a needle in a
      haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Cops, another community I'm not part of.</p>
    <p>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own
      set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm generally confused most of the time. This man is a knight in shining armor.</p>
    <p>Makes me a … scientist. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I love Halloween. The one
      time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to
      others.</p>
    <p>I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Makes me a … scientist. I'm generally
      confused most of the time. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
    <p>Keep your mind limber. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss.
      After all, you are a client. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark
      became my world and I could see.</p>
    <p>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. God created pudding, and then he rested. He taught me a code. To
      survive. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
    <p>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one
      day they will be. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Tell him time is of the essence.</p>
    <p>You all right, Dexter? I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm partial to air conditioning. Makes me a …
      scientist.</p>
    <p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Pretend. You pretend the
      feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
    <p>I'm really more an apartment person. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! You all right, Dexter? Cops,
      another community I'm not part of. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</p>
