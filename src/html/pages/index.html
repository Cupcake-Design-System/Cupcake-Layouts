    <h3>Below this is just dummy text.</h3>
    <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Rorschach would say you have
      a hard time relating to others. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Pretend. You pretend the feelings are
      there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my
        own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</li>
      <li>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</li>
      <li>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>This man is a knight in shining armor.</h4>
    <p>You look…perfect. I like seafood. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I am not a killer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're a killer. I catch killers.</li>
      <li>I'm really more an apartment person.</li>
      <li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
